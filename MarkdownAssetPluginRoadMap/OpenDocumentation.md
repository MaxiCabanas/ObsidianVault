Accion pressent in every AssetEditor window.

It opens (or creates) a new [[MarkdownAsset]] for the current asset being edited.

In the LevelEditor window currently opens the [Project Documentation File](MarkdownAssetPluginRoadMap/Project%20Documentation%20File.md). 

I need to [Add support for Levels documentation](MarkdownAssetPluginRoadMap/Add%20support%20for%20Levels%20documentation.md)
